Predicting student performance has become a vital focus in the education sector, as it
plays a key role in identifying students who may be at risk of under-performingandenabling timely interventions to support their academic success. However, a commonchallenge faced in this area is the presence of missing data within student records. Thesegaps often arise due to incomplete data entry, student absences, or administrativeoversights. When such incomplete data is used in predictive models, it can lead to biasedresults and lower the accuracy of predictions, ultimately affecting the fairness andeffectiveness of an interventions derived from the analysis. The motivation for this project stems from the desire to assist educational institutions inidentifying students who may need academic support. By leveraging machine learningalgorithms, especially techniques like Random Forests, and advanced datapre_processing methods such as MICE or KNN imputation, we can build a robust
prediction model. This model can help educators better understand the key determinants
of student success and tailor their support strategies accordingly.
